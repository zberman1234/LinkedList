###Manually implemented LinkedList class


Constructed using a Element class. Elements each contain a previous and next Elements, as well as the Elements key value

Included methods:
    - Insert, to insert a new Element into the list
    - Delete, to delete an Element from the list
    - Search, to return an element from the list

Biggest (and only real) challenge was pointing towards null Elements
